# üéì Smart Tutor AI ‚Äì Personalized Teaching Assistant  

**Institution:** University of North Texas

> Smart Tutor AI leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide context-aware, accurate, and personalized student support. It grounds every response in professor-validated course materials, addressing hallucination issues and aligning AI with academic integrity.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Conversational AI Chatbot:**  
  24/7 teaching assistant with course-grounded responses from uploaded PDFs, PPTs, DOCX, and YouTube videos.

- **RAG-Based Contextualization:**  
  Uses advanced retrieval + reranking to ensure LLMs provide accurate, relevant information.

- **Multimodal Support:**  
  Supports image uploads, diagrams, and YouTube lectures‚Äîextracting and indexing their content.

- **On-Demand Quiz Generator:**  
  Auto-generates MCQs and short answers from uploaded content with instant grading.

- **Smart Metadata & Resource Tagging:**  
  Automatically tags files by topic, source, date, and type to enhance retrieval efficiency.

- **Feedback & Continuous Evaluation:**  
  Real-time feedback via Langfuse and automated scoring with Evidently AI.
